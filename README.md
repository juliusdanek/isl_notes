## ISL Notes by Julius Danek

This repo contains notes for the book (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)[Intro to Statistical Learning] by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. 

### Solutions to exercises in Python

I am including iPython notebook solutions to the exercises in the book. I will try and finish these as best as possible. Feel free to submit pull requests in case you have more elegant ideas or in case of incorrect solutions.

### Defintions of concepts

In the .md file called "definitions" I included definitions to key terms as concisely as possible. Again, feel free to submit pull requests.
